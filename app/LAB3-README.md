# Lab 3: Android REST Client

This Android app retrieves and displays the data  of top-rated movies from TMDB with REST API.
It uses Retrofit to retrieve the data and RecyclerView to display a list of items.


## Running the Source Code

1. To run the tutorial code, you need an API key from The Movie DB, that should replace 
`"YOUR_API_KEY"` in `MainActivity.java`, and `MovieListActivity.java`.
2. Run the app on an emulator. It was tested on:
   - Resizable(Experimental) API UpsideDownCake (Android API 34 - Google APIs) 
   - Pixel 5 API UpsideDownCake  (Android API 34 - Google APIs)
3. Once the app is running, click 'Movie List' button, and you should be taken to `MovieListActivity`
and you should see the top-rated movies list displayed on the screen.
